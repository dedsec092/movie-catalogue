This project is a movie catalogue web application built using React.js and the TMDB API.

The Movie Catalogue Project is designed to allow users to browse, search, and discover information about movies using data fetched from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. Users can view details such as movie titles, descriptions, ratings, release dates, and more.
